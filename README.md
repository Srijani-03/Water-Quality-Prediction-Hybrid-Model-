# Water-Quality-Prediction-Hybrid-Model-

Getting access to clean and safe water is a blessing. Most of the rivers and waterways are being 
polluted now. Availability of water is crucial for healthy life style and ecological balance. 
Conventional Lab-based solutions are not enough to help this situation, they often struggle 
from delayed and sometimes wrong analysis reporting, resulting them unsuitable for 
preventive decision-making. This project brings a novel Deep Learning-based hybrid 
framework for forecasting time-series water quality parameters with an early alert system. This 
project used methods that analyse the physiochemical parameters from water quality datasets. 
It uses Deep Learning architectures like LSTM and Hybrid DL (LSTM + XGBoost) models 
to efficiently capture temporal dependencies and non-linear variations in the water conditions. 
A comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates that the DL models outperform the 
conventional Machine Learning models in accuracy and stability. On the other hand, the 
Alerting mechanism is used to alarm the stakeholders whenever the water quality deteriorates. 
This method enhances early risk detection and supports real-time ecosystem monitoring for 
improved aqua-health. Furthermore, this surveillance system can be installed in many different 
waterways like rivers, reservoirs and municipal areas for public health safety concerns.
